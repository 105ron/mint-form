# HTML Forms (with Mint)

This project is an introduction to basic HTML forms on HTML5 and styling practice to recreate [Mint.com](https://www.mint.com/) sign-in [form](https://mint.intuit.com/login.event?task=S&referrer=blog&soc=&utm=). This is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) HTML/CSS track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/html-forms?ref=lnav) for more information. The goal of the project is to clone this page without the dynamic functionality of the page or having the form actually submit.
